# Tests for the audit helpers (chezmoi-defaults-audit, chezmoi-security-audit)
# and for scripts/check-bash4-isms.sh, the pre-commit hook that guards the

# normalize_bool is extracted with sed and driven directly, same pattern as
# brew-sync.bats and the brewup() tests.
#
# Every test here drives real code rather than asserting on source text: a
# source-text assertion in bats is only advisory (bats isn't a required check
# on `main`), and it pins one spelling of a bug rather than the behaviour.
#
# Hermetic, like brew-sync.bats: nothing is written inside the chezmoi source
# state. The guard takes a scan-root argument so its probe files live in a
# temp dir — a probe left behind by an interrupted run would otherwise be
# deployable by the next `chezmoi apply` and show as `chezmoi verify` drift.
